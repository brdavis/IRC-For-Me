## Week 3 Report

  **What I've accomplished so far:**
  
  So far what I've accomplished has primarily been research based. Since this is my first time working with Git and Github I did a few tutorials in order to get acclimated and understand how to use both the site interface and the command line in linux. I then did research primarily on socket programming as well as brushed up on my java. I then began to code and have created a very basic client-server socket connection as the base for my IRC. Finally, I utilized the wiki section of this repository to outline individual project components so that I can keep focused while working on my project.  
  
  **What my goals are to accomplish next:**   
  
  My next goals are to dive heavily into the code of the project for the next few weeks. I hope to develop a fully functional IRC. Additionally, it would be a reach goal to add a GUI to my IRC.  
  
  **Potential obstacles:**    
  
  My potential obstacles are mostly just the learning curve of trying to use new tools while working on a software project independently.
