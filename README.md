# IRC-For-Me
This is a repository for creating an irc server and client in java


# Week 3 Report

  **What I've accomplished so far:**
  So far what I've accomplished has primarily been research based. Since this is my first time working with Git and Github I did a few tutorials in order to get acclimated and understand how to use both the site interface and the command line in linux. I then did research primarily on socket programming and brush up on my java. I then began to code and have created a very basic client-server socket connection as the base for my IRC.
  
  **What my goals are to accomplish next:**
  My next goals are to dive heavily into the code of the project for the next few weeks. I hope to develop a fully function IRC and it would be a reach goal to add a GUI to my IRC.
  
  **Potential obstacles:**
  My potential obstacles are mostly just the learning curve of trying to use new tools while working on a software project independently.
